                <h4>Music and Dance</h4>
                <p>
                    There's always been some interesting discussions regarding dance and how music influences our
                    physical abilities. How scientists are able to see the output of music's effect on our brains
                    and bodies and yet still is unable to determine why such an ethereal and stimulating response
                    can be sparked from sound waves. Similar to that of gravity, we don't know where it comes from
                    nor are we able to pinpoint why, but we do know however the behavior and results. Earth spins,
                    gravity happens. Same with music, our brains are triggered, but it's not one we can explain
                    the reasoning, we only know the why.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why are dance and music so intertwined? Well that's easier to explain, our emotional triggers
                    are also tied to our natural body movements and interpretation of what we hear. What's difficult
                    for me is to hear the music at all. It has been quite the journey since I've started. Not only
                    could I not hear music, I could not tell you what an up beat or downbeat was. Being a Physicist
                    I dove into the sound waves and theory behind why those waves would trigger such responses in
                    our bodies and the evolution to what we would today call modern dance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many facets of dance. So why would someone be so tied to a specific genre as compared
                    to another? This might be tied into the same reason why humans themselves are created so
                    differently. One book that comes to mind is Signature in the Cell by Stephen Meyer. It
                    ultimately drills down to the key factor that even makes up our chemical composition: DNA.
                    Which is such a fascinating subject in and of itself. Have you ever stopped to look at what
                    DNA actually stands for? Why stop at the acronym? DNA. Deoxyribonucleic Acid. Begging a deeper
                    question, why didn't we ask why in the first place? What is being bread into our innate human
                    curiosity that building inhibition to question?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why are we not allowed to ask why? What's stopping you from asking why?
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we do ask why, is there a reason for such blockade responses. Abrupt and terse. Did we offend
                    another because we simply are curious? Why did that person take it so, or take it as offending
                    their intelligence?
                </p>
                <p>
                    To ask why should be praised and meaningful. Questions to questions lead to more information,
                    insight, and beautifully carved questions out of human intellect. Without it, we wouldn't have
                    such an insatiable curiosity to do better, do more, and just do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Music is one of those insatiable stimulants we crave. You think with each passing increment or
                    collection of beats, a rhythm would form. Well not necessarily. Repeated white noise for example.
                    Still sounds, but not pleasing to the ear. This leads me to an original thought from years past
                    around music and its two categorical studies: the art of listening, and the art of composing. Two
                    vastly different categories, but there is a difference. We as listeners do ourselves and the music
                    we are listening to a disservice if we don't study the appreciation of listening and it's complex
                    artistic styling. After all, music is an art of time, which both mathematicians and physicists have
                    studied for millennia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So why as a musical people and community are we so harsh on those in studies who are drastically
                    diverse in comparison? Math, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Engineering, Calligraphy, Graphic Design,
                    Medium-Based Art, Technology, Security, Sign Language, Interpretation, Languages, etc. With each
                    category comes specialty and jack of all trades. In technology we call this a T-shaped developer.
                    Specialty in one area where your passion lies, and strong knowledge in remaining categories for a
                    well-rounded engineer and technologist. In Physics we have long believed that individuals do science
                    a disservice when research is not taken from a holistic viewpoint. Do you think there's a
                    correlation with the 21st century and it's lack of true scientific discoveries and breakthroughs?
                    Look back at those who were authored with finding of Deoxyribonucleic Acid: James Watson and
                    Francis Crick. James was a zoologist and Francis was a Physicist and nuero-scientist. Coincidence
                    that our educational system has numbed the human growth by inserting Standardized Testing and
                    Standards of Learning programs? The mark of a great scientist is not the quantity of learned
                    knowledge, it's the capacity for limitless imagination. Sparking imagination comes from teasing
                    one's brain to think outside of the box, not confining to a mold. Same with music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dancers and Scientists have much to learn from one another. Dancers feel the music, scientists
                    analyze the sound waves. Yet their goal is the same, demonstrate and express their electro-chemical
                    understanding of vibrations through their physical medium. Celebrate music and learn to love the
                    art of listening and what it has to offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coming from the educational system, I believe as though learning should never come to a close.
                    What's the purpose of anything if there truly is a limit? Immagine what you can learn and then
                    learn even more once you explored the obvious?!? Oh the true joy and happiness one can find through
                    learning; glorious.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dancers can do the same. And to do the dance, music, expression, and interpretation its best effort
                    should we not do the art justice by learning everything it has to offer and then more? After you've
                    learned music and what it means to you, learn music theory. Then you can really drill into why
                    you were more drawn to certain instruments and sounds as compared to others. Without reasoning and
                    results how can we even do the understanding of art justice? Words and language are both topics
                    with infinite discussions to be had. So put words to your understanding and then build on those
                    blocks to learn more and define what you and your expression means to the music as a dancer and
                    scientist. After all, are scientists and artists so different?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Foundations of dance are science and art. It's the perfect unity! Learn both sides and then take it
                    one step further: teach. This is where you must make a decision. Are you going to be a forever
                    student of dance and mentor those around you through your experiences, or are you willing to
                    take a leap and learn how others learn? This is yet again another categorical study the professional
                    and educational world have been researching since the beginning. How to teach, how to learn, and
                    how to teach so that others learn? All mindsets and understandings are different so how are we
                    supposed to teach what we mean versus what's actually being said? There's the skill. It can be
                    learned to be a good professor of dance, but to be great one must truly learn how others learn.
                    Without that, we do ourselves, our students, and our mentors injustice. Being a great student
                    means being a great learner, and being a great teacher means learning how your students learn. Are
                    you then yourself not a student once again? What an elegant and beautiful cycle!

                <h4>Passing Thoughts - Blog 2</h4>
                <p>
                    Had some passing thoughts the other day, did some mental reiterations on the meaning of such
                    wording, and thought experimented with its seeded ideation. Mind sometimes wonders, and these
                    phrases I thought rang quite true with purposeful work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to understand why my drive for helping others and increasing quality of time with my
                    surroundings. Bringing myself to professional work, I thought about success and failure,
                    which side of the coin has taught me more and how balancing acts provide best outcomes.

                    I was recently dancing in another state and had such a deep soul-filled connection with another
                    that I needed to relate that feeling to something more organic.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Dancing is like breathing, sometimes you just gotta take a deep cleansing breath.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    I then continued to thoughtfully question again why certain human interactions are so authentic
                    and others are forced....Came to the following conclusion:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        As with many internationally recognized dances, there is both a science to technique and a
                        science to art. Perfection is driven factor. With West Cost Swing (WCS), there is a science
                        to technique, but there is no exact science to art. This is because we incorporate both
                        American and International leg styling, and with that comes uniqueness and individualism.
                        This is why WCS becomes so partner variant, and is that not the reason we draw both on
                        technical training and variance in our styling? It's the unique look we strive for!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It's who we are as dancers and who we are as persons. Our charisms shine through our style,
                        layered on that beautiful WCS technical foundation.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    After such realization and reinvesting why the status quo must always change, I wanted to further
                    think upon why human nature is an insatiable drive so deeply rooted in our DNA that to be better
                    and more knowledgeable and mentally present that I realized it's not about the end, nor the
                    beginning, the purpose of destination is the journey; that journey with which our life's purpose
                    is to live the journey and enjoy this ever evolving life experience continuum. So I condensed
                    my thoughts into the following statement and found another helpful surmising reference.

                    The greeks and the romans had a way with their words. Almost as though the words themselves were

                        You’re too smart for your own good means that you’ve already gone through all possible outcomes

                        appropriate causality and supporting arguments, and you’ve thought about potential incoming
                        shards. At this point, you just have to do business promotion, marketing, and bringing
                        others up to speed. This is hardest for an analytical or driver because it means you have to
                        slow down. And in reality it will have best outcome when slowing down because others are able
                        to fill in marketing gaps, assisted support, and collective forward progress which one cannot
                        possibly fathom alone.

                        If an impressive (yellow) says something first, that’s what a general public will see. So

                    A simple correlation is like Peanut Butter and Jelly. Both materials exist, but the combination,
                    and supplement of new unique materials, provides the consumer with a tremendously more beneficial

                    workshop. Four core principles of Dwow: Self evaluation, Self awareness, Self compartmentalization,
                    Self presentation.

                <p>
                    Certain principles are more effective than others, and look to methodically orient best practices that
                    come out of hyper affective sessions. Repeatable and reusable programs that need to be implemented
                    both on an individual and holistic scale are Hackathons, Transition Development Plans, Transition
                    Acceleration Models, Paired Programming, Swarm Sessions, and very much needed Thought Experiments.
                    Each in isolation are very powerful and unique; however, when used in combination create such
                    a force that productivity increases exponentially and efficiency becomes the standard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has been proven that pair programming, swarm sessions, and hackathons are all ways to produce a
                    performing state, and agile that minimizes burnout, and increases productivity , across-the-board. But
                    that being said the ways in which the digital world has enabled us to do so, are expedited, educational
                    programs or learning sessions through a paired style, that we will referred to as paired knowledge
                    sharing. This way, having two keyboards on the same monitor set up, let’s play multiplying effect take
                    place for both users senses. It not only helps the lesser trained individual in this respective field,
                    but also helps the trainer. It helps the trainee by expediting their learning through multiplicative
                    solutions. Multiplication comes from multiple senses being used: the auditory sense by listening to the
                    trainer explain and type at the same time, visual senses by watching solutions, take place and being
                    able to see them in action, the touch sense, because the keyboard in which the trainee is typing also
                    replicate a muscle, memory addition, and Socio economic growth through proximity of a more experienced
                    individual and the subject matter being referenced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also helps the trainer because it will force that individual to re-evaluate why thoughts and sequences
                    of solution, and were brought about throughout the problem stage. The solution in stage is rather the
                    more simplistic one in nature, because it is an experimentation phase of the ideation, which was
                    occurring through the problem solving analytical skills of the trainer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The efficiency of swarm sessions, both code located, and centrally located, are beneficial to all parties
                    in place, including the company with which the sponsored event or session is taking place. This is
                    because not only is it expanded version of the paired knowledge session sharing, but also an advancement
                    of product development and delivery through which natural evolution can not occur at a hyper scale for
                    software applications. (Go into more depth about how to sponsor a swarming session)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once these other methodologies are in place, a expedition of product development can occur through a
                    Hackathon. The swim session and paired knowledge sessions are not to be confused with time advancement
                    or left shifting of a roadmap. It is an advancement of product delivery, and or evolution. A hackathon
                    and if it’s self is a gathering of individuals where key players and customers as well as colleagues are
                    involved with the event and it is a non-time driven occurrence. It will take place over 12 to 48 a super
                    scale of hybrid delivery. This event needs to be succeeded by a couple if not few day relaxation. Where
                    employees are able to rejuvenate, and re-gather themselves. Cases where a hackathon is, most useful is
                    around the areas of new product ideation, large blockers, and behind schedule product paired
                    programming, knowledge, sharing, sessions, or swim sessions should suffice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of these in conjunction will provide the best solution for a software team, looking to be agile and
                    have agility in product development. I wear most useful a team can extract certain parts of this
                    methodology and ways of working to increase their productivity across the board, however, when
                    leveraging ceremonies appropriately and other highly effective software development, frameworks a
                    development team, will increase their productivity in much a compounded fashion, as compared to linear,
                    when adopting other methodologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Benefits include advance, product delivery, near eliminatory employee burnout, and also fiscal
                    consciousness of travel expenses.

                <h4>Philosophy on Uniqueness - Blog 0</h4>
                <p>
                    Our uniqueness is what makes us special, not a conformity to business practices and corporate
                    propaganda. So why not get that chance? Well you have to start somewhere, and it's a lot of
                    work, but with strong community everyone has the opportunity to shine. That's my goal,
                    be a person who can provide a real life example of what I've experienced to provide insight
                    so others have more knowledge going into their own experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is by no means a billboard posting to say "hey we need to change everything", rather
                    it's a viewpoint on what transitional periods look like, so you can have an insight
                    to take into your ventures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's great about millennials (yes there is something great about the entitled culture)
                    is that it teaches us how people want to be satisfied, and how to prevent that in ourselves.
                    Simple reference I use in the tech space: if you can build an app to satisfy a millennial,
                    you've built an app to satisfy all users. It's therefore intuitive, straightforward to use,
                    simplistic in nature, and very servitude based.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So why keep anything from the previous generation? Also a great question. Because you lose
                    experience, knowledge, and learned procedures you'll never once gain again. Ok fair, a person
                    from a newer generation may be more "book learned", if they're reading enough material to
                    formulate and postulate ideas and opinions based on multiple perspectives, but there's one
                    thing the newer generation will never have on the older: experience. Time gives experience,
                    and even someone 10 minutes older than you has more experience on this earth. So regardless
                    of their credentials, give credence to their perspective and learn from it. Einstein himself
                    stated that if you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room. Which further
                    proves another quote of his: there's no such thing as a fact; there's only experimentally
                    proven theories which can just as quickly be disproved by another theory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One book I truly recommend is the autobiography of Nikola Tesla. If someone could pack
                    a million thoughts into one sentence it's him. For a publication with less than a few dozen
                    pages, there is a treasure mine of thought put into conciseness that even the elegance
                    of wording proves arabesque and rhythmic in its artistry. He writes in such a way
                    that it's almost as though he knew how to trigger thoughts from the reader and inspire
                    those thoughts to be the readers own. A beautiful quote states: a true scientist is not
                    one of quantified book knowledge, no, rather it's the power to their imagination that
                    makes their possibilities limitless.
